Feel free to communicate with your partner about the code, your observations, your decisions, and potential solutions to the tasks below. You may also use the internet to look up documentation, StackOverflow, etc.

## Installation

npm install
npm start
```

or

## Tasks

You can complete the following tasks in any order, and don't feel like you need to complete them all in the time allowed.

* As a user, I'd like to update the weather widget title.
* As a user, I'd like to see the wind speed in mph (miles per hour) when temperature is toggled to fahrenheit.
* As a user, I'd like to see the weather widget in the center of the page (vertically and horizontally centered).

* As a developer, I would like to optimise the application to improve code reusability.
